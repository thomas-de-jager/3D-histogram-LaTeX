# 3D-histogram-LaTeX
A proposed 3D-histogram LaTeX template.
Code is not optimised and the max value has to be adjusted if the number of rows in the .csv file changed, otherwise the scale of the figure will not be presented correctly.
Code is made with the help of the Tex.Stackexchange community and other sources: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/52987/3-dimensional-histogram-in-pgfplots, https://www.siavoosh.com/blog/2019/01/13/trying-3d-bar-graph-histogram-with-tikz-in-latex/, https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/52987/3-dimensional-histogram-in-pgfplots, https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/491565/3d-histogram-bar-chart.
Tested and working on Overleaf at the time of writing.
